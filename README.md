<h1 align="center">⚠️</h1>
<h2 align="center">Flashcord is currently completely broken due to the recent client mods being entirely broken. No, OpenASAR will not work with Flashcord right now as classes have been rerolled too and the naming of most if not every classes have changed, requiring a heafty rewrite of certain parts of the code. Flashcord will be back up as soon as Replugged starts working again. Until now, development is on hold.</h2>

# 📸 This. This is Flashcord Beta.
## The world's most complex Discord Theme.
## It's all about the chat space.

## But also for the eye candy.

## The ridiculously insane [customization](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Variables#%EF%B8%8F-custom-background-mode) and [integration](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Flashcord-Modules).

## And the whole [new layer of expression](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Chat-Effects) for messages.

# 📑 Getting Started: Check the Flashcord Wiki
### That's right this theme has a bloody arch wiki manual page knock-off. Get ready to RTFM.
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, yes, I am not kidding. This Discord Theme has a wiki page. **And trust me, you seriously need it.**
