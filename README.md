<h1 align="center">⚠️</h1>
<h2 align="center">Flashcord is currently completely broken due to the recent class rolls and naming changes. Due to Discord also recently forcing their clients to crash the moment DevTools are opened, progress to fix Flashcord is insanely slow. Please understand that it will take a while before everything goes back to normal.</h2>

# 📸 This. This is Flashcord Beta.
## The world's most complex Discord Theme.
## It's all about the chat space.

# 📑 Getting Started: Check the Flashcord Wiki
### That's right this theme has a bloody arch wiki manual page knock-off. Get ready to RTFM.
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, yes, I am not kidding. This Discord Theme has a wiki page. **And trust me, you seriously need it.**
