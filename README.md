## Flashcord's Development is currently slow.
Flashcord is honestly very usable right now and some of my other projects (notably my channel and SNWE/SNDL) desperately need attention. I apologize for the extremely long waits between update. Flashcord's development as a result is going way slower than expected as I am focusing on other stuff and trying to get rid of the gigantic burn out I got from working on this theme for now almost a year.
Sometimes I really do wish I was a robot...

# 📑 Getting Started: Check the Flashcord Wiki
### That's right this theme has a bloody arch wiki manual page knock-off. Get ready to RTFM.
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, yes, I am not kidding. This Discord Theme has a wiki page. **And trust me, you seriously need it.**

Flashcord is currently in Beta, expect lots of things to change and quickly! Next major version will be Flashcord Gamma, set to release in 2024 if everything goes according to plan. By 2025, Flashcord should hopefully be done.
